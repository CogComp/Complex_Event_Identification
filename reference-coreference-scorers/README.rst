Reference Coreference Scorer
============================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is the official implementation of the revised coreference scorer
used for CoNLL-2011/2012 shared tasks on coreference resolution. It
addresses issues that prevented the consistent scoring of predicted
mentions in the past.


VERSION
-------

The current stable (official) version for scoring predicted mentions is **v8.01**

CITATION
--------

We would appreciate if you cite the paper when you use this scorer as
some of us are academics or wanting to be academics, and citations
matter.

USAGE
-----

  ::

     perl scorer.pl <metric> <key> <response> [<document-id>]


     <metric>: the metric desired to score the results. one of the following values:

     muc: MUCScorer (Vilain et al, 1995)
     bcub: B-Cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998)
     ceafm: CEAF (Luo et al., 2005) using mention-based similarity
     ceafe: CEAF (Luo et al., 2005) using entity-based similarity
     blanc: BLANC (Luo et al., 2014) BLANC metric for gold and predicted mentions
     all: uses all the metrics to score

     <key>: file with expected coreference chains in CoNLL-2011/2012 format

     <response>: file with output of coreference system (CoNLL-2011/2012 format)
 
     <document-id>: optional. The name of the document to score. If name is not
                    given, all the documents in the dataset will be scored. If given
                    name is "none" then all the documents are scored but only total
                    results are shown.


OUTPUT
------

The score subroutine returns an array with four values in this order:

Coreference Score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  ::

    Recall = recall_numerator / recall_denominator
    Precision = precision_numerator / precision_denominator
    F1 = 2 * Recall * Precision / (Recall + Precision)

These values are to standard output when variable ``$VERBOSE`` is not null.


Identification of Mentions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A score for identification of mentions (recall, precision and F1) is
also included.  Mentions from system response are compared with key
mentions. This version performs strict mention matching as was used in
the CoNLL-2011 and 2012 shared tasks.
